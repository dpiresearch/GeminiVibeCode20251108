Look at the history_200.log file to see how the env in the AMD cloud was set up
packaged_XXXXX.py is a sample Triton file that was generated by this project.
It was the translated cuda->triton code, then packaged to run on the AMD GPU

AMD GPU was configured with Roc 6.4 and 1 GPU ( 1.99/hr )

The github projects pulled into the AMD GPU are:
